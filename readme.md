# clox

This repository contains my implementation of the _clox_ interpreter described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (2021), by Robert Nystrom. This is a work-in-progress, but I aim to eventually complete the implementation as described in the book. I also intend to add my own comprehensive comments throughout the codebase, for educational purposes.

My notes on _jlox_, the book's simpler and less efficient Java-based interpreter, can be found [here](https://github.com/jhelsby/jlox-notes). They cover many of the high-level concepts used in _clox_.

_jlox_ and _clox_ interpret the book's language, Lox. Lox is a simple, dynamically typed, object-oriented language. Its built-in data types are booleans, numbers, strings, and nil.
